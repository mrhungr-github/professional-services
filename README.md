## Tools
The tools folder contains ready-made utilities which can simpilfy Google Cloud Platform usage.


* [BigQuery Committed Use Discounts (CUD)/Sustained Use Discounts (SUD) Per-project Attribution](tools/kunskap) - A tool that automates the generation of a Bigquery table that uses existing exported billing data, by attributing both CUD and SUD charges on a per-project basis.
* [AssetInventory](tools/asset-inventory) - Import Cloud Asset Inventory resourcs into BigQuery.
* [BigQuery Committed Use Discounts (CUD)/Sustained Use Discounts (SUD) Per-project Attribution](tools/kunskap) - A tool that automates the generation of a Bigquery table that uses existing exported billing data, by attributing both CUD and SUD charges on a per-project basis.
* [CloudConnect](tools/cloudconnect) - A package that automates the setup of dual VPN tunnels between AWS and GCP.
* [Cloudera Parcel GCS Connector](tools/cloudera-parcel-gcsconnector) - This script helps you create a Cloudera parcel that includes Google Cloud Storage connector. The parcel can be deployed on a Cloudera managed cluster.

* [DNS Sync](tools/dns-sync) - Sync a Cloud DNS zone with GCE resources. Instances and load balancers are added to the cloud DNS zone as they start from compute_engine_activity log events sent from a pub/sub push subscription. Can sync multiple projects to a single Cloud DNS zone.
* [GCE Quota Sync](tools/gce-quota-sync) - A tool that fetches resource quota usage from the GCE API and synchronizes it to Stackdriver as a custom metric, where it can be used to define automated alerts.
* [GCP Architecture Visualizer](/tools/gcp-arch-viz) - A tool that takes CSV output from a Forseti Inventory scan and draws out a dynamic hierarchical tree diagram of org -> folders -> projects -> gcp_resources using the D3.js javascript library.
* [GCS Bucket Mover](tools/gcs-bucket-mover) - A tool to move user's bucket, including objects, metadata, and ACL, from one project to another.
* [GKE Billing Export](tools/gke-billing-export) - Google Kubernetes Engine fine grained billing export.
* [GSuite Exporter](tools/gsuite-exporter/) - A Python package that automates syncing Admin SDK APIs activity reports to a GCP destination. The module takes entries from the chosen Admin SDK API, converts them into the appropriate format for the destination, and exports them to a destination (e.g: Stackdriver Logging).
* [LabelMaker](tools/labelmaker) - A tool that reads key:value pairs from a json file and labels the running instance and all attached drives accordingly.
* [Maven Archetype Dataflow](tools/maven-archetype-dataflow) - A maven archetype which bootstraps a Dataflow project with common plugins pre-configured to help maintain high code quality.
